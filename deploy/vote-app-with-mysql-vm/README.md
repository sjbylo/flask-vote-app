# Deploy vote-app + MySQL with a VM running either RHEL or Centos-Stream9

This yaml should work out-of-the-box as long as the "centos-stream9" DataSource exists in the "openshift-virtualization-os-images" namespace which is normally created after a default installation of OpenShift Virtualization.   If not, then ... see below "Create a DataSource". 

Create the application:

```
oc new-project myproj
oc apply -f vote-app-mysql-vm-all-in-one.yaml
```

If OCP is behind a proxy, use the following. Be sure to edit the 3 "*_proxy" vars to suit your environment:
```
oc new-project myproj
oc apply -f vote-app-mysql-vm-all-in-one-with-proxy.yaml
```

Note that it will take up to 5 mins for the MySQL VM to launch and run its cloud-init script to install, configure and run MySQL.  See the log file /var/log/cloud-init-output.log to troubleshoot. 

Tested with Centos-Stream9 and RHEL9.

## Create a DataSource

Use the source creation feature when creating a PVC (e.g. download from URL) or "With Data upload" features to create it.

Upload an image from https://cloud.centos.org/centos/
e.g.
https://cloud.centos.org/centos/8-stream/x86_64/images/CentOS-Stream-GenericCloud-8-20210603.0.x86_64.qcow2
or something newer.

```
        source:
          pvc:
            name: centos-stream9
            namespace: openshift-virtualization-os-images
```
